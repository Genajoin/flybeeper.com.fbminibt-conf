# FlyBeeper True Air Speed

## Manual

### Operating Modes

The device operates in several modes.

The first mode is Bluetooth connection standby. Every 4 seconds, the device sends an advertising packet, allowing it to be detected for connection initialization. Between advertising packets, the device is in sleep mode. The time spent in this mode is limited only by the battery charge level. The power consumption is minimal, allowing the device to operate in this mode throughout the entire flight season.

As soon as the device receives a connection request, the second mode is activated. The connection does not require a preliminary device pairing procedure through the operating system interface. You can immediately launch the flight application and connect through its interface. The device name is FBTAS. Once connected, it is possible to read the battery level and subscribe to changes in sensor values. In the latter case, periodic reading of data from the necessary sensors is activated. The device is in sleep mode between intervals. When the Bluetooth connection is disconnected, the device returns to standby mode with periodic transmission of advertising packets.

Reconnection mode: In case of a lost connection, the device switches to a mode with an increased frequency of advertising packets for a few minutes to ensure quick reconnection. This mode is also activated immediately after pressing the reset button. This can be used to speed up the initial connection procedure in your application.

There is a transport mode where the device remains in sleep mode continuously and does not transmit any Bluetooth data. This mode is used during air transportation or for long-term storage between seasons. It is the mode with the lowest power consumption.

### Placement

#### For Paragliders

The standard position is on the harness using a line with a length of 1 meter under the pilot, attached to the carabiner. The tail fin ensures self-alignment with the airflow. The line length should allow the device to be distanced from the pilotâ€™s harness to avoid the influence of the compressed airflow. Insufficient distancing will result in speed readings being higher than actual. The device's low weight and low frontal resistance help effectively counteract the pendulum effect, but if the line is too long, undesirable oscillations may occur.

In non-standard positions, such as attaching to the tail fairing of the harness, consider the compression/expansion of the airflow. This variation also depends on speed and will affect the device's readings.

#### For Hang Gliders

A special mounting element should be used instead of the tail fin, which firmly fixes the device to the hang glider frame parallel to the plane of the wing. Do not place the device too close to the wing in the compression zone of the airflow.

### Control

The device has no controls other than the reset button. The device is always ready to connect except when in transport mode.

To exit transport mode, press the reset button once. The button is small and located 1 mm from the edge of the casing. Be careful. Use a thin wooden or plastic stick to avoid accidentally shorting unprotected contact pads.

To activate transport mode, press the reset button once, then press it again after 1-2 seconds. If you have successfully entered transport mode, you will not be able to detect or connect to the device via Bluetooth.

### Charging

The prototype device has a `USB Type C` port for charging; however, it only supports simple chargers that consistently output 5V, such as USB ports on personal computers. Smart chargers and `PD` are not supported.

The final device includes a built-in solar panel and does not require any other charging method.

### Configuration

You can test and configure the device through the graphical interface of the [configurator](https://fbminibt-conf.flybeeper.com/settings). You need a device with a Bluetooth module, such as a smartphone, laptop, or PC with Bluetooth. Click `Connect` and select `FBTAS` from the list. Keep the devices as close to each other as possible. Change any parameter and click `Apply`. You can view all the data sent by the device in real time on the `Cockpit` tab.

`Pitot K factor (o.e.)` - a calibration coefficient that accounts for the structural pressure loss in the Pitot tube and the pathway to the differential pressure sensor. Increasing this coefficient proportionally increases the IAS and TAS readings. It can be adjusted based on ground speed measurement results in perfectly still air.
`Differential Pressure offset, Pa` - the offset of the differential pressure sensor relative to still air. The default is 0, as the standard sensor has built-in auto-calibration. However, in some experimental device models, you may need to adjust the offset to compensate for sensor drift.

### Communication Protocol Description

This section is intended more for developers than for regular users.

The device operates using the BLE protocol without pairing and authorization. Changes to each parameter are available via subscription (descriptor 0x2902). All non-standard parameters have 128-bit UUIDs, descriptor 0x2901 with a textual parameter name, and descriptor 0x2904 with a description of the format, exponent, and unit of measurement. For convenience, their values are listed in the tables below.
